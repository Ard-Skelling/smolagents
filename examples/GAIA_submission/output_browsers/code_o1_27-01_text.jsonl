Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'time\\', \\'re\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'queue\\', \\'collections\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'random\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\\n')", "TaskStep(task=\"It is paramount that you complete this task and provide a correct answer.\\n    Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

(Large cogwheels turn. We journey around a large stone building with leaded windows, narrow corridors, spiral staircases up tall towers, grills covering sets of large cogwheels set into the stonework, and every few yards screens hang on the walls, full of static.) DOCTOR [OC]: You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. It moves slowly, but it never stops. Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it will follow. Never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run. It will walk. You will rest. It will not. One day, you will linger in the same place too long. You will sit too still or sleep too deep, and when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then be over.  **[Teleport chamber room]**  (In a large room containing a teleport (note- not a transmat) chamber and its separate control console, a blackened hand reaches for a lever, squeezes the grip to release it, and pulls. The owner of the hand gasps and falls, cogs turn, and the hand turns to dust. Light fills the teleport chamber and the Doctor appears, coughing and gasping. The machinery slows and stops. He opens the curved perspex door of the teleport chamber and steps out, closing it behind him. He remembers the moment the Quantum Shade raven entered Clara's body, then scoops a handful of sand from the floor and lets it trickle though his fingers.) DOCTOR: If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.   **[Tower]**  (The Doctor cautiously leaves the room and goes anticlockwise along a curved corridor with deep square openings cut in the outer wall to admit light. He leans out of one to see the shadows of spokes cast on the ground far below. Then he looks up at the outside of a tall tower.) DOCTOR: The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was, and I'm in the same time zone.  (He looks up out of another opening at the sky then across a courtyard at more towers. Then he starts to walk back clockwise.)  DOCTOR: When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding. Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen. (He finds a spade with soil on it leaning against the inner wall.) DOCTOR: Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop! The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do about yours! (A black and white circular image forms on the screens. It is a view of him, from someone looking through a narrow slit in a wall. He looks out of the nearest opening at the wall across the courtyard.

(Large cogwheels turn. We journey around a large stone building with leaded windows, narrow corridors, spiral staircases up tall towers, grills covering sets of large cogwheels set into the stonework, and every few yards screens hang on the walls, full of static.) DOCTOR [OC]: You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. It moves slowly, but it never stops. Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it will follow. Never faster, never slower, always coming. You will run. It will walk. You will rest. It will not. One day, you will linger in the same place too long. You will sit too still or sleep too deep, and when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. Your life will then be over.  **[Teleport chamber room]**  (In a large room containing a teleport (note- not a transmat) chamber and its separate control console, a blackened hand reaches for a lever, squeezes the grip to release it, and pulls. The owner of the hand gasps and falls, cogs turn, and the hand turns to dust. Light fills the teleport chamber and the Doctor appears, coughing and gasping. The machinery slows and stops. He opens the curved perspex door of the teleport chamber and steps out, closing it behind him. He remembers the moment the Quantum Shade raven entered Clara's body, then scoops a handful of sand from the floor and lets it trickle though his fingers.) DOCTOR: If you think because she is dead, I am weak, then you understand very little. If you were any part of killing her, and you're not afraid, then you understand nothing at all. So, for your own sake, understand this. I am the Doctor. I'm coming to find you, and I will never, ever stop.   **[Tower]**  (The Doctor cautiously leaves the room and goes anticlockwise along a curved corridor with deep square openings cut in the outer wall to admit light. He leans out of one to see the shadows of spokes cast on the ground far below. Then he looks up at the outside of a tall tower.) DOCTOR: The equipment in that room is consistent with an augmented ultra long-range teleport. So, I'm not more than a single light year from where I was, and I'm in the same time zone.  (He looks up out of another opening at the sky then across a courtyard at more towers. Then he starts to walk back clockwise.)  DOCTOR: When the sun sets, I'll be able to establish an exact position by the stars. Then you'll have a choice. Come out, show yourself, or keep on hiding. Clara said I shouldn't take revenge. You should know, I don't always listen. (He finds a spade with soil on it leaning against the inner wall.) DOCTOR: Oh, what's this? Well, are you gardeners? I hate gardening! What sort of a person has a power complex about flowers? It's dictatorship for inadequates. Or to put it another way, it's dictatorship. Come on! Chop, chop! The Doctor will see you now! Show me what you've got! I just watched my best friend die in agony. My day can't get any worse. Let's see what we can do about yours! (A black and white circular image forms on the screens. It is a view of him, from someone looking through a narrow slit in a wall. He looks out of the nearest opening at the wall across the courtyard.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

This disconnect with traditional dragons has been bemoaned as ruining the mythic and archetypal power of dragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than readily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore, from which many children\u2019s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories. Modern tamed and human-like children\u2019s literature dragons borrow certain uncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not always life-threatening characters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons\u2019 intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech. This article analyzes these Freudian inheritances to argue that children\u2019s literature dragons have not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are still strong characters and can and should be analyzed productively through a Freudian uncanny lens.\\n\\n*Keywords*: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children\u2019s literature\\n\\n*Biography*: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children\u2019s Literature) is teaching and working on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\\n\\nJ.R.R.

Dragons in mythology have come to be recognized for their value as representations of ancient cultures or as worldwide archetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies; medievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have flourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children\u2019s literature as one of its most pervasive mythic animals.\\n\\nYet within children\u2019s literature, scholars have noted a trend beginning even before the dragon\u2019s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of friendly dragon has become a well known resident of children\u2019s books, this article argues that children\u2019s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for uncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many modern children\u2019s literature dragons.\\n\\nFluffy Dragons\\n--------------\\n\\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more laughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame\u2019s \u201cThe Reluctant Dragon\u201d in 1898. Ruth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly cuddly, \u201cfluffy\u201d nature of dragons in children\u2019s literature. In a short article for *Elementary Education*, Stein expresses hope that Tolkien\u2019s Smaug would improve the literary dragon\u2019s evolution and encourage properly scary dragons. While this has since proved true in part, the bemoaned fluffy dragons remain prevalent alongside Tolkien\u2019s menacing breed. Nonetheless Blount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they could be less than terrifying and still remain \u201creal dragons\u201d (129). She points out several stories that fail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally behave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in order to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a \u201creal\u201d dragon is and even praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame\u2019s dragon, as parodies of the outdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223). Hope Shastri\u2019s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support the observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of 151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons have preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children\u2019s literature. She divides picture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure), Wildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien\u2019s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend or a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire, consuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these categories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively lost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become tame and meek\u2014especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as opposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees with Shastri\u2019s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with some hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars over the past two decades indicates that dragons in children\u2019s books are increasingly humorous and less and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\\n\\nDragons and the Uncanny\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThere may be more potent dragons lurking in children\u2019s literature than these observations and studies indicate, due to one significant aspect of Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The traits listed by Shastri focus on characteristics of the dragons themselves but do not include the emotional environment created by the dragon within the literature or with the audience. Stott acknowledges the fear inspired by traditional dragons due to their size and fierce temper, but his analysis addresses only the physical threat of the dragons and implies that this fear is entirely lost when parodied (224). Blount comes close to recognizing this deeper psychological effect of dragons when she writes that a quality children\u2019s literature dragon should still inspire awe. Awe and fear, yes, but the original dragons of Germanic lore from which children\u2019s literature dragons descended were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling atmosphere in their stories.\\n\\nThis uncanny quality of these ancestral dragons derives from their unnatural similarity to the heroes who defeat them; the dragons are doubles for humanity.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6.

When we started moving our product beyond a simple REPL and started adding IDE features, we had to invent standards and wrappers around every language tool for our frontend to consume. For every editor feature, say errors and warnings (linting), we had to extend our development protocol with a set of commands and data structures, and then teach our development containers how to wrap the given tool, say Pylint, and our frontend on how to consume it (say annotate the editor with errors and warnings). A similar thing has been happening with IDEs for the past few decades -- every editor had to come up with their in-house ad-hoc protocol, and every tool developer had to build adapters and wrappers for editors to consume.\\n\\nHowever, this is about to change: a couple of years ago, Microsoft\\'s VS Code team announced [\"A Common Protocol for Languages\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol), a single all-encompassing protocol that provides general-purpose language tooling -- be it refactoring, code-completion, or errors and warnings -- all implemented once and then seamlessly plugged into any editor that understands this protocol \u2014 this was dubbed the \"Language Server Protocol\" [(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).\\n\\nIn addition to LSP, VS Code also open-sourced the editor that powers VS Code: [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Monaco is an editor built with web technologies, and since we started looking at LSP a few months ago, it only made sense for us to transition to Monaco first. Even before the introduction of LSP on Repl.it, Monaco allowed us to provide some cool language features (Smart Autocomplete, Go to Definition, Find References) for TypeScript and JavaScript because they\\'re bundled with the editor. On top of that, the editor has a slick feel to it.\\n\\nIn this release, we\\'re rolling out language servers for Python (2, 3 and Django), C, C++, and ReasonML. And soon we\\'ll be adding support for more languages -- Java and Ruby are looking to be next in line.\\n\\nLet\\'s run through some of the features:\\n\\n### Autocomplete and signatures\\n\\n![autocomplete and signatures](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F5a2acaa7d4eef3794b9b2faa99b9ea03df26a0ce-1000x750.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nautocomplete and signatures\\n\\n### Jump to definition\\n\\n![jump to definition](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F86715301014d898ba080a9e49e7054dde86b5e0f-1000x812.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\njump to definition\\n\\n### Find references\\n\\n![find references](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F74680409bd7b9751fba51ae45b71609b6ef277b7-1000x810.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nfind references\\n\\n### Refactor\\n\\n![refractor](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F66219f51a3a225eb4caf9b3593a4101c487273d0-1000x810.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nrefractor\\n\\n### Linting\\n\\n![linting](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F40895028e337d2cdb567170eb4599cedaac4b88d-1000x840.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nlinting\\n\\n### Hover\\n\\n![hover](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F474239486a8fd2bf71e49eec301fdf187bd3b043-1000x769.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nhover\\n\\n### Formatting\\n\\n![formatting](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fbj34pdbp%2Fmigration%2F26e5f9a2af40de4415deb8b447e5e4161ee41c67-1000x769.gif&w=3840&q=75)\\n\\nformatting\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nGive it a spin by going to the [languages](/languages) page and selecting one of the supported languages (Python, ReasonML, C, C++ for now).\\n\\nThis release gets us one step closer to our vision of building what we call \"[a holistic development service](https://repl.it/site/blog/holistic),\" a long-lived always-on service that understands your code in all its stages and that you can use anywhere and at anytime, regardless of your device, platform, location, or your programming language.\\n\\nWe\\'ve given ourselves the impossible task of building a top-notch ready-to-use development environment for every language under the sun.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\\n')", "TaskStep(task=\"It is paramount that you complete this task and provide a correct answer.\\n    Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Even though the PhC is structurally imperfect, the existence of leaky modes, determined both theoretically and experimentally in the broad spectral region, implies that an efficient light interaction with a material periodicity occurs in the sample. It is shown that the luminescence emission spectrum of a light source placed directly on the PhC surface can be modified by employing the optical modes of the studied structure. We stress also the impact of intrinsic optical losses of the nano-diamond on this modification.\\n\\n### Similar content being viewed by others\\n\\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-020-75718-x/MediaObjects/41598_2020_75718_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n### [Diamond step-index nanowaveguide to structure light efficiently in near and deep ultraviolet regimes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75718-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n28 October 2020\\n\\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-021-24560-4/MediaObjects/41467_2021_24560_Fig1_HTML.png)\\n### [Phonon-assisted up-conversion photoluminescence of quantum dots](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24560-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n13 July 2021\\n\\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41377-021-00525-6/MediaObjects/41377_2021_525_Figa_HTML.png)\\n### [Quantum-dot microlasers based on whispering gallery mode resonators](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-021-00525-6?fromPaywallRec=false)\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n15 April 2021\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nPhotonic crystal (PhC) slabs are structures of finite height which are periodically patterned \\nLast output from code snippet:\\nNone', observations_images=None, action_output=None)", "ActionStep(agent_memory=None, tool_calls=[ToolCall(name='python_interpreter', arguments='final_answer(\"diamond\")', id='call_6')], start_time=1738014655.64726, end_time=1738014658.916023, step_number=4, error=None, duration=3.2687630653381348, llm_output='The article \"Diamond photonic crystal slab: Leaky modes and modified photoluminescence emission of surface-deposited quantum dots\" mentions a \"nano-diamond layer\" as the compound studied.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8.
