Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'datetime\\', \\'helium\\', \\'time\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'re\\', \\'collections\\', \\'queue\\', \\'random\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'statistics\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'stat\\', \\'queue\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'helium\\', \\'random\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'time\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'math\\', \\'re\\', \\'collections\\']\\n9.

This indicates that the scene takes place inside a castle during the day. The script describes the castle as having spires and towers, highlighting its ancient and sprawling nature. The Doctor\\'s voice is heard narrating as the scene presents the sunrise viewed through windows in a stone wall. The scene provides a mysterious atmosphere and sets up the episode\\'s tone by introducing a monologue from the Doctor about life and its journey. This immersive and atmospheric opening sequence aligns with the overall complex and suspenseful narrative typical of \"Doctor Who\" episodes, compelling viewers to engage with the unfolding story.\\n\\n3. Additional Context on the document and question asked:\\nThe document is a script for the \"Doctor Who\" television series, specifically for Series 9, Episode 11, titled \"Heaven Sent\" as written by Steven Moffat. Scene headings are crucial elements in scripts as they indicate the location and time of a scene, directing the production team and actors. The opening scene in the castle sets the stage for a mysterious and psychological journey, characteristic of Moffat\\'s narrative style, as it deals with themes of introspection and survival. The scene reflects the intricate storytelling of \"Doctor Who,\" which often involves the Doctor in a complex puzzle or challenge, as indicated by his arrival in an ancient castle and the onset of his introspective monologue.\\nLast output from code snippet:\\nNone\\nCurrent url: data:,', observations_images=[<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1000x805 at 0x13A9110D0>], action_output=None)", "ActionStep(agent_memory=None, tool_calls=[ToolCall(name='python_interpreter', arguments='final_answer(\"INT.

The question is in French.\\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\\n{\\'question\\': \\'Quel est l\\'animal sur l\\'image?\\', \\'image\\': \\'path/to/image.jpg\\'}\"\\n\\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\\nCode:\\n```py\\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\\n\\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\\nprint(pages)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\\n\\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let\\'s compute the result using python code.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\\n\\n\\n- go_back: Goes back to previous page.\\n    Takes inputs: {}\\n    Returns an output of type: null\\n\\n- close_popups: Closes any visible modal or pop-up on the page. Use this to dismiss pop-up windows! This does not work on cookie consent banners.\\n    Takes inputs: {}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n\\n- search_item_ctrl_f: Searches for text on the current page via Ctrl + F and jumps to the nth occurrence.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'text\\': {\\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'description\\': \\'The text to search for\\'}, \\'nth_result\\': {\\'type\\': \\'integer\\', \\'nullable\\': True, \\'description\\': \\'Which occurrence to jump to (default: 1)\\'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n\\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'query\\': {\\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'description\\': \\'The search query to perform.\\'}, \\'filter_year\\': {\\'type\\': \\'integer\\', \\'description\\': \\'Optionally restrict results to a certain year\\', \\'nullable\\': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'file_path\\': {\\'description\\': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a \\'.something\\' file, like \\'.pdf\\'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", \\'type\\': \\'string\\'}, \\'question\\': {\\'description\\': \\'[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence.

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'collections\\', \\'stat\\', \\'math\\', \\'helium\\', \\'time\\', \\'re\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.\\n')", "TaskStep(task='It is paramount that you complete this task and provide a correct answer.\\n    Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it.

For example:\\nCode:\\n```py\\nif Text(\\'Accept cookies?\\').exists():\\n    click(\\'I accept\\')\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nProceed in several steps rather than trying to solve the task in one shot.\\nAnd at the end, only when you have your answer, return your final answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\"YOUR_ANSWER_HERE\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nIf pages seem stuck on loading, you might have to wait, for instance `import time` and run `time.sleep(5.0)`.

Don't bother about the helium driver, it's already managed.\nFirst you need to import everything from helium, then you can perform other actions!\nAfter each code blob that you generate, the action will be run and a screenshot of the new current webbrowser page will be taken.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom helium import *\ngo_to('github.com/trending')\n```<end_code>\n\nYou can directly click elements by inputting the text that appears on them.\nCode:\n```py\nclick(\"Top products\")\n```<end_code>\n\nIf it's a link:\nCode:\n```py\nclick(Link(\"Top products\"))\n```<end_code>\n\nIf you try to interact with an element and it's not found, you'll get a LookupError.\nIn general, stop your action after each button click to see what happened on your screenshot.\nNever try to login in a page.\n\nTo scroll up or down, use scroll_down or scroll_up with as an argument the number of pixels to scroll from.\nCode:\n```py\nscroll_down(num_pixels=1200) # This will scroll one viewport down\n```<end_code>\n\nWhen you have pop-ups with a cross icon to close, don't try to click the close icon by finding its element or targeting an 'X' element (this most often fails).\nJust use your built-in tool `close_popups` to close them:\nCode:\n```py\nclose_popups()\n```<end_code>\n\nYou can use .exists() to check for the existence of an element. For example:\nCode:\n```py\nif Text('Accept cookies?').exists():\n    click('I accept')\n```<end_code>\n\nProceed in several steps rather than trying to solve the task in one shot.\nAnd at the end, only when you have your answer, return your final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"YOUR_ANSWER_HERE\")\n```<end_code>\n\nIf pages seem stuck on loading, you might have to wait, for instance `import time` and run `time.sleep(5.0)`. But don't overuse this!\nTo list elements on page, DO NOT try code-based element searches like 'contributors = find_all(S(\"ol > li\"))': just look at the latest screenshot you have and read it visually, or use your tool search_item_ctrl_f.\nOf course, you can act on buttons like a user would do when navigating.\nAfter each code blob you write, you will be automatically provided with an updated screenshot of the browser and the current browser url.\nBut beware that the screenshot will only be taken at the end of the whole action, it won't see intermediate states.\nDon't kill the browser.\nTo navigate through many pages, use page numbers in urls rather than clicking through endless pages!\nAny web browser controls won't work on .pdf urls, rather use the tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to read them.\n", "prediction": "Li Peng", "intermediate_steps": ["SystemPromptStep(system_prompt='You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'stat\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'helium\\', \\'time\\', \\'collections\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'math\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'re\\', \\'datetime\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'random\\', \\'stat\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'helium\\', \\'time\\', \\'collections\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'math\\', \\'itertools\\', \\'queue\\', \\'re\\', \\'datetime\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up! You\\'re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow Begin!

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

But don't overuse this!\nTo list elements on page, DO NOT try code-based element searches like 'contributors = find_all(S(\"ol > li\"))': just look at the latest screenshot you have and read it visually, or use your tool search_item_ctrl_f.\nOf course, you can act on buttons like a user would do when navigating.\nAfter each code blob you write, you will be automatically provided with an updated screenshot of the browser and the current browser url.\nBut beware that the screenshot will only be taken at the end of the whole action, it won't see intermediate states.\nDon't kill the browser.\nTo navigate through many pages, use page numbers in urls rather than clicking through endless pages!\nAny web browser controls won't work on .pdf urls, rather use the tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to read them.\n", "prediction": "Spain", "intermediate_steps": ["SystemPromptStep(system_prompt='You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs.

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'itertools\\', \\'re\\', \\'helium\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'random\\', \\'collections\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'queue\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Always provide a \\'Thought:\\' sequence, and a \\'Code:\\n```py\\' sequence ending with \\'```<end_code>\\' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'itertools\\', \\'re\\', \\'helium\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'random\\', \\'collections\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'queue\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.

The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!

Failure or 'I cannot answer' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.\n    Here is the task:\n    Who nominated the only Featured Article on English Wikipedia about a dinosaur that was promoted in November 2016?\n\nYou have been given no local files to access.\nFor web searches start with your google search tool.\nThen you can use helium to access websites (don't use helium on google, rather use your google search tool).\nDon't bother about the helium driver, it's already managed.\nFirst you need to import everything from helium, then you can perform other actions!\nAfter each code blob that you generate, the action will be run and a screenshot of the new current webbrowser page will be taken.\nCode:\n```py\nfrom helium import *\ngo_to('github.com/trending')\n```<end_code>\n\nYou can directly click elements by inputting the text that appears on them.\nCode:\n```py\nclick(\"Top products\")\n```<end_code>\n\nIf it's a link:\nCode:\n```py\nclick(Link(\"Top products\"))\n```<end_code>\n\nIf you try to interact with an element and it's not found, you'll get a LookupError.\nTo click a search bar, you may use `click(S(\"input[type='text']\"))`\nIn general, stop your action after each button click to see what happened on your screenshot.\nNever try to login in a page.\n\nTo scroll up or down, use scroll_down or scroll_up with as an argument the number of pixels to scroll from.\nCode:\n```py\nscroll_down(num_pixels=1200) # This will scroll one viewport down\n```<end_code>\n\nWhen you have pop-ups with a cross icon to close, don't try to click the close icon by finding its element or targeting an 'X' element (this most often fails).\nJust use your built-in tool `close_popups` to close them:\nCode:\n```py\nclose_popups()\n```<end_code>\n\nYou can use .exists() to check for the existence of an element. For example:\nCode:\n```py\nif Text('Accept cookies?').exists():\n    click('I accept')\n```<end_code>\n\nProceed in several steps rather than trying to solve the task in one shot.\nAnd at the end, only when you have your answer, return your final answer.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"YOUR_ANSWER_HERE\")\n```<end_code>\n\nIf pages seem stuck on loading, you might have to wait, for instance `import time` and run `time.sleep(5.0)`. But don't overuse this!\nTo list elements on page, DO NOT try code-based element searches like 'contributors = find_all(S(\"ol > li\"))': just look at the latest screenshot you have and read it visually, or use your tool search_item_ctrl_f.\nOf course, you can act on buttons like a user would do when navigating.\nAfter each code blob you write, you will be automatically provided with an updated screenshot of the browser and the current browser url.\nBut beware that the screenshot will only be taken at the end of the whole action, it won't see intermediate states.\nDon't kill the browser.\nTo navigate through many pages, use page numbers in urls rather than clicking through endless pages!\nAny web browser controls won't work on .pdf urls, rather use the tool 'inspect_file_as_text' to read them.\n", "prediction": "FunkMonk", "intermediate_steps": ["SystemPromptStep(system_prompt='You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs.

Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in \\'answer = wiki({\\'query\\': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})\\', but use the arguments directly as in \\'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")\\'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don\\'t name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don\\'t name a variable \\'final_answer\\'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: [\\'itertools\\', \\'re\\', \\'helium\\', \\'datetime\\', \\'random\\', \\'collections\\', \\'time\\', \\'unicodedata\\', \\'math\\', \\'stat\\', \\'statistics\\', \\'queue\\']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you\\'ve created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don\\'t give up!
